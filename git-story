Punk and Matilda are two very spoiled cats, who live very spoiled lives in a colorful and quirky apartment in Logan Square Chicago.

Punk is a large, orange tabby, and like a proper ginger has a nose covered in freckles.

Matilda is a gigantic ball of fluff with a very tiny meow.

They spend their days taking naps, more or less ignoring all the toys they have, and sitting in the windows at the front of the apartment, keeping track of things happening in the neighborhood.

Punk loves to play fetch, and make escape attempts into the back yard.

Matilda is very stubborn about food, and will occasionally sit a hunger strike until she is presented with shrimp.

Anyone who meets them agrees that they are the best cats to ever cat.

The end.
